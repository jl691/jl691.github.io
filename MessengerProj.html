                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                For my first case study, I wanted guidance on the design process. I found a free UI/UX course from
                Students Who Design. The first assignment in the course included exploration of Facebook Messenger
                mobile (version 278.0). I happened to venture into Message Requests. When I clicked on the Spam folder,
                I found that a message from someone from my hometown, who was going to the same college as me, and
                wanted to join the same club, had messaged me two years ago!

                Hypothesis
            </h2>
            <p>
                A hypothesis I had was that Message Requests could be improved to complete more interactions. I went
                into my user interviews with an objective to find the pain points of Message Requests on Messenger
                mobile.

                User Interviews
            </h2>

           <p>After my interviews, I came away with these insights:     </p> 

            <ol>
                <li> <b>The level of visibility of Message Requests needs to be adjusted for its purpose.</b> So out of the
                    way, but
                    not ‘hidden’. Some people found Message requests hard to find, while also appreciating the
                    separation of
                    it from the ‘normal’ inbox.
                </li>

                <li> <b>People only check Message Requests with a specific purpose in mind </b>(whether it be a notification,
                    respond to a potential club member, buying or selling on Marketplace, looking for a roommate, to
                    friend
                    a girlfriend’s dad, to plan a surprise party). One anecdote from an interviewee involved a sister of
                    a
                    coworker planning a surprise party. Her message went to Requests, where it sat unread for a week. It
                    took a message from someone the interviewee was already friends with to get him to see the Request,
                    which he responded to immediately, since he felt bad about missing the message.
                </li>
                <li> <b>People don’t mind responding to strangers if the message has a purpose for them and the person is a
                    person/is not a bot. </b>See purposes mentioned above.
                </li>
                <li> <b>People have unwanted contact from people in MR.</b>
                    Insight: Sorting through the messages depends on who they are and what they want, in order for FB
                    filtering to be accurate (especially when regarding spam). Messenger is good at hiding away the
                    unwanted
                    stuff,( but ultimately it’s up to people to decide what to do. There is no way a message from an
                    estranged family member will go to spam)
                </li>
            </ol>
