        <p>
            For my first case study, I found a free UI/UX course from<a href="https://www.studentswho.design/">Students
                Who Design</a>. It includes three lecture videos and three videos in this self-paced course. The goal of
            the course is a redesign of Facebook Messenger mobile (version 278.0).

            The Challenge
        </h2>
        <p>
            How can Message Requests be improved to complete more interactions? I went
            into my user interviews with an objective to find the pain points of Message Requests on Messenger
            mobile.
        </p>

    <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">
            User Interviews
        </h2>

        <p>After my interviews, I came away with these insights: </p>

        <ol>
            <li> <b>The level of visibility of Message Requests needs to be adjusted for its purpose.</b> Some people
                found Message Requests hard to find, while also appreciating theseparation of Requests from the Chats
                inbox, where all their friends are.
            </li>

            <li> <b>People only check Message Requests with a specific purpose in mind.</b> Examples of purposes might
                be to respond to a notification, to buy or sell on Marketplace, to look for a roommate, to get in
                contact with your girlfriend's dad, or to plan a surprise party).
                <!-- One anecdote from an interviewee involved a sister of a
                coworker planning a surprise party. Her message went to Requests, where it sat unread for a week. It
                took a message from someone the interviewee was already friends with to get him to see the Request,
                which he responded to immediately, since he felt bad about missing the message. -->
            </li>
            <li> <b>People don’t mind responding to strangers if the message has a purpose and the person is not a bot
                    or spam.</b> See purposes mentioned above.
            </li>
            <li> <b>People have unwanted contact from people in Message Requests.</b> Messenger tries to keep as much
                unwanted contact away from the user with the Spam folder inside Message Requests, but there is no way
                Messenger has an algorithm that determines your estranged relative should go into the Spam folder.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p> After processing the information from user interviews, I refined my hypothesis.</p>
        <p> People would respond to Message Requests, but can’t because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Message Request visibility needs to be adjusted. </b> One person said they felt ‘scattered’ trying to
                look for Message Requests, when I asked them to show me how to get to Requests on their phone. At the
                same time, people appreciated how Message Requests separated out chats from strangers from chats with
                their friends.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>People don’t respond to Message Requests because they don’t have a reason to check Requests often.
                </b>The scenarios a few people gave during the interviews where they would go out of their way to check
                Requests, would be if they were looking for a roommate or selling/buying on Marketplace.
            </li>
        </ol>

            Brainstorming Solutions
        </h2>
        <p>
            I brainstormed features to solve the problem stated above. These are the (initial) top three features
            after I did a SWOT analysis and looked at feasability/impact:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Subject lines for Message Requests.</b> Have a stamp to show the category of the message. I picked
                this feature because in the user research, people mentioned they would respond to a Message Request if
                the request showed a clear purpose.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Group Message Requests similarly to how Marketplace chats are grouped. </b>Marketplace chat grouping
                is a feature in Facebook Messenger, where if someone messaged you regarding buying/selling on
                Marketplace, the Marketplace chat would pop to top of the Chats list. I was thinking of applying this to
                Message Requests; that way,
                Message Requests will only be at the top of the Chats if someone sends them a request.
            </li>
            <!-- <div class="cs-img"> <img src="images/marketplace.JPG"> </div> -->
            <li> <b>Add a red badge icon to the Spam folder within Message Requests. </b> From user research, people
                said that they liked a spam-free inbox. But at the same time, people found it awkward responding to
                Message
                Requests weeks later. One person I interviewed told me that had an anecdote: when she checked the Spam
                folder, she found that someone from her hometown, who was going to the same college as her, and
                wanted to join the same club, had messaged her two years ago. </li>
        </ol>
        <!-- NEED TO HAVE CAPTION -->
        <div class="imgDisplayContainer">
            <div class="cs-img"> <img src="images/postits.JPG"> </div>
        </div>

        <p> I started sketching out these features and what they might look like. During the process, I
            wasn't entirely satisfied with the solutions that I brainstormed. I was doing some self-reflecting during
            each stage of the design process, but I wanted guidance and feedback as well. I called my friend, Martina,
            who
            is a UI/UX designer.
        </p>
        <!-- NEED TO HAVE CAPTION -->

            <div class="cs-img"> <img src="images/spamSketch.png"> </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Some key lessons I learned from Martina is to always remember the problem you are trying to solve and who
            you are trying to solve it for. When I told her about the 'stamp' feature for Message Requests, she asked,
            "What would the stamps accomplish without a person’s profile picture and their identifier? Why would you
            need stamps in the context of Message Requests?". I also talked to her about my uncertainty in the decisions
            I've made in
            the design process. Martina reassured me by saying that you can always iterate again and again, since at
            different stages of the design process, new information will come to you. That made me realize if I feel I
            am headed the wrong way, I can always turn back or course correct.

        <h2 class="section-title">
            Brainstorming Solutions...Again
        </h2>

        <p> After reflecting with my friend about the design direction I was headed, I decided to revisit the list of
            solution features I brainstormed. I scratched the stamp feature, because while trying to answer 'what would
            stamps accomplish in the context of Message Requests', I found my answers were shoddy at best. I was hoping
            they would be eye-catching and therefore people would open up the request and respond to it. I realized the
            main problem was adjusting the visibility of Message Requests.
        </p>

        <p> My features I went forward in the design process with were chosen because they solve the visibility problem
            of Message Requests that gets in the way of people from responding to them. I decided to add notifications
            to the Spam folder, and to move Message Requests to the main Chats view.</p>

    <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="section-title"> Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            I had a few entry point, middle section, and end point scenarios and user flows that I tested out. I decided
            to place Message Requests at the bottom navigation bar to make Requests more visible. One of the questions I
            asked during my interviews was 'Show me how to get to Message Requests'. Users often first clicked on the
            'People' tab at the navigation bar. The badge for Message Requests notifications will always be visible at
            the bottom.

            <!-- I need to do a better job at explaining why i chose what i did -->

        </p>
        <p>
            For the Spam notifications, I kept it consistent with how Messenger already shows unread chats.

        <h2 class="section-title">What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
            The main takeaway from this case study is that I learned a design process. I learned one way to come up with
            a People Problem, gained knowledge about user research, familiarized myself with Figma, and learned how to
            wireframe and prototype. During these steps, I realized that it is important to document your progress and
            to be able to articulate clearly why I went with one feature, design, user flow, etc. over another.

            I also learned that design is about; it's not just about me or one individual person. That's why it's
            important to listen to stories, and to keep awareness of your biases. I need to make decisions informed by
            the people, not based off of what I think is flashy or what <i>I</i> think people would want.
