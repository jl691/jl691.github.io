            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            For my first case study, I found a free UI/UX course from
            Students Who Design. It includes three lecture videos and three videos in this self-run course. The first
            assignment in the course included exploration of Facebook Messenger
            mobile (version 278.0).

            Hypothesis
        </h2>
        <p>
            A hypothesis I had was that Message Requests could be improved to complete more interactions. I went
            into my user interviews with an objective to find the pain points of Message Requests on Messenger
            mobile.

            User Interviews
        </h2>

        <p>After my interviews, I came away with these insights: </p>

        <ol>
            <li> <b>The level of visibility of Message Requests needs to be adjusted for its purpose.</b> So out of the
                way, but
                not ‘hidden’. Some people found Message requests hard to find, while also appreciating the
                separation of
                it from the ‘normal’ inbox.
            </li>

            <li> <b>People only check Message Requests with a specific purpose in mind </b>(whether it be a
                notification,
                respond to a potential club member, buying or selling on Marketplace, looking for a roommate, to
                friend
                a girlfriend’s dad, to plan a surprise party). One anecdote from an interviewee involved a sister of
                a
                coworker planning a surprise party. Her message went to Requests, where it sat unread for a week. It
                took a message from someone the interviewee was already friends with to get him to see the Request,
                which he responded to immediately, since he felt bad about missing the message.
            </li>
            <li> <b>People don’t mind responding to strangers if the message has a purpose and the person is a
                    person/is not a bot. </b>See purposes mentioned above.
            </li>
            <li> <b>People have unwanted contact from people in MR.</b>
                Insight: Sorting through the messages depends on who they are and what they want, in order for FB
                filtering to be accurate (especially when regarding spam). Messenger is good at hiding away the
                unwanted
                stuff,( but ultimately it’s up to people to decide what to do. There is no way a message from an
                estranged family member will go to spam)
            </li>
        </ol>

            People Problem Statement
        </h2>
        <p> People would respond to message Requests, but can’t because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Message Request visibility needs to be adjusted. </b> One person said they felt ‘scattered’ trying to
                look for Message Requests, when I asked them to show me how to get to Requests on their phone. At the
                same time, people appreciated how Message Requests separated out chats from strangers from chats with
                their friends.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>People don’t respond to Message Requests because they don’t have a reason to check Requests often.
                </b>The scenarios a few people gave during the interviews where they would go out of their way to check
                Requests, would be if they were looking for a roommate or selling/buying on Marketplace.

            Brainstorming Features
        </h2>
        <p>
            I brainstormed features to solve the people problem stated above. I picked an (initial) top three features
            after I did a SWOT analysis and looked at feasability/impact:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Subject lines for Message Requests.</b> Have a stamp to show the category of the message. I picked
                this feature because in the user research, people mentioned they would respond to a Message Request if
                the request showed a clear purpose.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Group Message Requests similarly to how Marketplace chats are grouped. </b>Marketplace chat grouping
                is
                a feature in Facebook Messenger, where if someone messaged you about an item, the Marketplace chat
                would pop to the the Chats list. I was thinking of applying this to Message Requests; that way,
                Message Requests will only be at the top of the Chats if someone sends them a request.</li>
            <!-- INSERT IMAGE OF MARKETPLACE CHAT FEATURE -->
            <li> <b>Add a red badge icon to the Spam folder within Message Requests. </b> From user research, people
                said
                that they liked a spam-free inbox. But at the same time, people found it awkward responding to Message
                Requests weeks later. One person had an anecdote: I happened to venture into Message Requests. When I
                clicked on the Spam folder,
                I found that a message from someone from my hometown, who was going to the same college as me, and
                wanted to join the same club, had messaged me two years ago! </li>
        </ol>
        <p> I started sketching out these features and what they might look like on the screen. During the process, I
            wasn't entirely satisfied with the solutions that I brainstormed. I was doing some self-reflecting during
            each stage of the design process (such as after I conducted user interviews, I wrote a few notes on what I
            should have done differently), but I wanted guidance and feedback as well. I called my friend, Martina, who
            is a UI/UX designer.
        </p>
        <!-- INSERT IMAGE OF INITIAL SKETCHES -->
        <p>
            Some key lessons I learned from Martina is to always remember the problem you are trying to solve and who
            you are trying to solve it for. When I told her about the 'stamp' feature for Message Requests, she asked,
            "What would the stamps accomplish without a person’s profile picture and their identifier? Why would you
            need stamps in the context of MR?". I also talked to her about my uncertainty in the decisions I've made in
            the design process. Martina reassured me by saying that you can always iterate again and again, since at
            different stages of the design process, new information will come to you. That made me realize if I feel
            like the train I'm on is headed the wrong way, I can always turn back or course correct.

            Brainstorming Features...Again
        </h2>

        <p> After reflecting with my friend about the design direction I was headed, I decided to revisit the list of
            solution features I brainstormed. I scratched the stamp feature because while trying to answer 'what would
            stamps accomplish in the context of Message Requests', I found my answers were shoddy at best. I was hoping
            they would be eye-catching and therefore people would open up the request and respond to it. I realized the
            main problem was adjusting the visibility of Message Requests.
        </p>

        <p> My features I went forward in the design process with were chosen because they solve the visibility problem
            of Message Requests that gets in the way of people from responding to them. I decided to add notifications
            to the Spam folder, and to move Message Requests to the main Chats view.</p>

        <!-- Using the combination of the spam count notification with increasing the visibility of MR will address the problem of missed connections. There are a lot of anecdotes about hidden or missed messages, or finding a message weeks later and feeling awkward responding to it because of how much time had passed. In addition, according to my user research, people do like the MR spam functionality and how it keeps the unwanted messages and spam hidden away.

What makes MR hard to find is that it is 2 clicks away, and not something people typically check. In addition, the spam filtering system isn’t perfect. Yes, it filters out some spam most of the time, but it also tucks away actually important messages as well. I think addressing both of these problems, while maintaing the aspects of the feature people actually like, will improve Messenger and solve my people problem.
